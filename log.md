# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Full stack web applicationed "Classy News". Today I pair programmed with two others in my cohort at CraftAcademy. We worked on the backend, incorporating Stripe. And on the front end, we included i18n for internationalization. 

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow we are having a sprint review with our coaches to review our progress. Plan for Sprint Review with client:

We're currently on schedule
- Deployment (done)
- User can log in (api & client - done)
- Journalist can create an article (api & client - done)
- Journalist can add images when they create an article (api & client - done)
- Payment functionality for 1 year with Stripe (api - done, client 80 % done)

 Currently working on & to do this sprint:
- User can see full article (api - done /client done but not merged)
- User can read articles in English and/or Swedish (client)
- User can navigate through the site with a navbar (client)
- Newsite changes language depending on browser language settings (client).
- Final part of client-side Stripe-functionality
- Mobil eapplication!

(So far we've completed 11 features + setup, working on 5 features (backend & frontend). )

Since you requested a mobileapp we need to re-allocate resources and won't be able to complete the planned features for the desktop application. We're going to reprioritize and focus on creating a mobile application and a desktop application with focus on news delivery.

### Day 1: November 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: We started today with a scrum at 9am to review yesterdays progress and to-dos for today. Today we worked on the Stripe cypress tests. We were having issues with the user authorization - 
**For context:**
- A visitor can subscribe
- A subscriber can view articles
- A journalist can write articles
- An editor can publish journalist articles

To fix this issue, we had to make some changes to the test to make sure that a subscriber and a journalist was actually being created. 
We also updated the seed file on the backend to display articles in a list format.
And on the front end, we created happy & sad paths for viewing a single article. 

**Thoughts**: Today was a challenging day. As projects become more complex, and more features are added, I realize the importance of organized pair-programming and teamwork/collaboration. My team consists of individuals at varying skill levels. This is beneficial as it promotes teaching and growth, but as fast-paced individuals gain traction, it can leave others behind without an understanding of what the code does/or how to test it. 

We recognized this half way through the day and took some time to communicate with one another about the code that we wrote and made a plan for next steps. The second half of the day was very productive and I sensed a collaborative environment that was lacking prior to our discussion.
