# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Full stack web applicationed "Classy News". Today I pair programmed with two others in my cohort at CraftAcademy. We worked on the backend, incorporating Stripe. And on the front end, we included i18n for internationalization. 

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow we are having a sprint review with our coaches to review our progress. Plan for Sprint Review with client:

We're currently on schedule
- Deployment (done)
- User can log in (api & client - done)
- Journalist can create an article (api & client - done)
- Journalist can add images when they create an article (api & client - done)
- Payment functionality for 1 year with Stripe (api - done, client 80 % done)

 Currently working on & to do this sprint:
- User can see full article (api - done /client done but not merged)
- User can read articles in English and/or Swedish (client)
- User can navigate through the site with a navbar (client)
- Newsite changes language depending on browser language settings (client).
- Final part of client-side Stripe-functionality
- Mobil eapplication!

(So far we've completed 11 features + setup, working on 5 features (backend & frontend). )

Since you requested a mobileapp we need to re-allocate resources and won't be able to complete the planned features for the desktop application. We're going to reprioritize and focus on creating a mobile application and a desktop application with focus on news delivery.
